            <h3>INDIAN</h3>
            <p><a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_cuisine" class = "cuisine-intro" target="_blank">From Wikipedia</a></p>
            <p>Indian cuisine consists of a variety of regional and traditional cuisines native to the Indian subcontinent. 
            Given the diversity in soil, climate, culture, ethnic groups, and occupations, these cuisines vary substantially 
            and use locally available spices, herbs, vegetables, and fruits.
            Indian food is also heavily influenced by religion, in particular Hinduism and Islam, cultural choices and 
            traditions.
            Historical events such as invasions, trade relations, and colonialism have played a role in introducing certain 
            foods to this country. The Columbian discovery of the New World brought a number of new vegetables and fruit to 
            India. A number of these such as potatoes, tomatoes, chillies, peanuts, and guava have become staples in many regions of India.
            Indian cuisine has shaped the history of international relations; the spice trade between India and Europe was the 
            primary catalyst for Europe's Age of Discovery. Spices were bought from India and traded around Europe and Asia. 
            Indian cuisine has influenced other cuisines across the world, especially those from Europe (especially Britain), 
            the Middle East, Southern African, East Africa, Southeast Asia, North America, Mauritius, Fiji, Oceania, and the 
            Caribbean. </p>

                        <h3> Instructions </h3>
                        <ol class="instructions">
                            <li><p>Mix the Ginger-Garlic Paste, coriander, turmeric, and 1/2 cup water in a small bowl. This is a simple wet masala (spice mix). Set aside. </p></li>
                            <li><p>In a large pot, warm the oil over medium-high heat until shimmering but not smoking. Add the serrano pepper, wait 30 seconds, and then add the cumin seeds and wait until they're done spluttering. </p></li>
                            <li><p>Add the wet masala (careful, it will also splutter). Cook until the paste thickens, deepens in color slightly, and oil oozes out of the perimeter of the masala, about 2 minutes. </p></li>
                            <li><p>Add the cauliflower and potatoes, stirring to coat the vegetables with the masala. Season with salt and add 1/2 cup water. Cover and cook over medium heat 10 to 15 minutes. Then, remove the lid, stir, and cook until the cauliflower and potatoes are cooked through, about 5 minutes. Garnish with cilantro and serve. </p></li>
                            <li><p>Throw the garlic, ginger, and canola oil in a mini-food processor and let it go until it forms a semi-smooth paste. There will still be tiny little pieces in there, but overall, it should resemble a paste. </p></li>
                            <li><p>Save what you don't use in a small glass jar. It should last in the fridge for 2 to 3 weeks. It's a delicious addition to marinades, pasta sauces, stir fry sauces, slow-cooker recipes, gravy etc. We always had a jar of this stuff in our fridge growing up.  </p></li>

                <p>Aloo gobi is a vegetarian dish from the Indian subcontinent made with potatoes, cauliflower, and Indian spices. It is popular in Indian and Pakistani cuisines, and found its way to the US in part to traditional Indian restaurants in places like California. It is yellowish in colour due to the use of turmeric, and occasionally contains kalonji and curry leaves. Other common ingredients include garlic, ginger, onion, coriander stalks, tomato, peas, and cumin.</p>
