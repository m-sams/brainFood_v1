            <h4>INDIA</h4>
            <p><a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India" class = "credit-link" target="_blank"> From Wikipedia</a></p>
            <p>India, officially the Republic of India (Hindi: Bhārat Gaṇarājya), is a country in South Asia. It is the 
              seventh-largest country by area, the second-most populous country, and the most populous democracy in the world. 
              Bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on the southwest, and the Bay of Bengal on the 
              southeast, it shares land borders with Pakistan to the west; China, Nepal, and Bhutan to the north; and 
              Bangladesh and Myanmar to the east. In the Indian Ocean, India is in the vicinity of Sri Lanka and the 
              Maldives; its Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with Thailand, Myanmar and Indonesia. 
              With 1,210,193,422 residents reported in the 2011 provisional census report, India is the world's second-most populous 
              country. Its population grew by 17.64% from 2001 to 2011, compared to 21.54% growth in the previous decade 
              (1991–2001). The human sex ratio, according to the 2011 census, is 940 females per 1,000 males. The median age was 
              28.7 as of 2020. The first post-colonial census, conducted in 1951, counted 361 million people. Medical advances 
              made in the last 50 years as well as increased agricultural productivity brought about by the "Green Revolution" 
              have caused India's population to grow rapidly. According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the Indian economy in 2020 was nominally worth 
              $2.7 trillion; it is the sixth-largest economy by market exchange rates, and is around $8.9 trillion, 
              the third-largest by purchasing power parity (PPP). With its average annual GDP growth rate of 5.8% over 
              the past two decades, and reaching 6.1% during 2011–2012, India is one of the world's fastest-growing economies.
              However, the country ranks 139th in the world in nominal GDP per capita and 118th in GDP per capita at PPP.
              Until 1991, all Indian governments followed protectionist policies that were influenced by socialist economics. 
              Widespread state intervention and regulation largely walled the economy off from the outside world. 
              An acute balance of payments crisis in 1991 forced the nation to liberalise its economy; 
              since then it has moved slowly towards a free-market system by emphasising both foreign trade and direct 
              investment inflows.India has been a member of WTO since 1 January 1995.</p>

            <p><a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy" class = "credit-link" target="_blank"> From Wikipedia</a></p>
            <p>Italy (Italian: Italia), officially the Italian Republic (Italian: Repubblica Italiana), 
              is a country consisting of a peninsula delimited by the Alps and several islands surrounding it, 
              whose territory largely coincides with the homonymous geographical region. 
              Italy is located in the centre of the Mediterranean Sea, in Southern Europe, 
              and is also considered part of Western Europe. A unitary parliamentary republic with Rome as its capital 
              and largest city, the country covers a total area of 301,340 km2 (116,350 sq mi) and shares land borders with 
              France, Switzerland, Austria, Slovenia, and the enclaved microstates of Vatican City and San Marino. Italy 
              has a territorial exclave in Switzerland (Campione) and a maritime exclave in Tunisian waters (Lampedusa). 
              With around 60 million inhabitants, Italy is the third-most populous member state of the European Union.
              Italy, whose territory largely coincides with the homonymous geographical region, is located in Southern Europe and 
              it is also considered a part of western Europe, between latitudes 35° and 47° N, and longitudes 6° and 19° E. To the 
              north, Italy borders France, Switzerland, Austria, and Slovenia and is roughly delimited by the Alpine watershed, 
              enclosing the Po Valley and the Venetian Plain. To the south, it consists of the entirety of the Italian Peninsula 
              and the two Mediterranean islands of Sicily and Sardinia (the two biggest islands of the Mediterranean), in addition 
              to many smaller islands. The sovereign states of San Marino and the Vatican City are enclaves within Italy, 
              while Campione d'Italia is an Italian exclave in Switzerland. Italy has a major advanced capitalist mixed economy, ranking as the third-largest in the Eurozone and the 
              eighth-largest in the world. A founding member of the G7, the Eurozone and the OECD, it is regarded as one of the 
              world's most industrialised nations and a leading country in world trade and exports. It is a highly developed 
              country, with the world's 8th highest quality of life in 2005 and the 26th Human Development Index. The country is 
              well known for its creative and innovative business, a large and competitive agricultural sector 
              (with the world's largest wine production), and for its influential and high-quality automobile, machinery, 
              food, design and fashion industry.</p>

            <p><a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China" class = "credit-link" target="_blank"> From Wikipedia</a></p>
            <p>China (Chinese: 中国; pinyin: Zhōngguó), officially the People's Republic of China 
              (PRC; Chinese: 中华人民共和国; pinyin: Zhōnghuá Rénmín Gònghéguó), is a country in East Asia. It is the world's 
              most populous country, with a population of more than 1.4 billion. China spans five geographical time zones and 
              borders 14 different countries, the second most of any country in the world after Russia. Covering an area of 
              approximately 9.6 million square kilometers (3,700,000 sq mi), it is the world's third or fourth largest country. 
              The country consists of 23 provinces, four municipalities, five autonomous regions, and two Special Administrative 
              Regions (Hong Kong and Macau). The national capital is Beijing, the largest city and financial center is Shanghai, 
              and Shenzhen serves as the technological and innovative hub. China is the world's largest economy by GDP at purchasing power parity and the second-largest economy by nominal 
              GDP and the world's second wealthiest country. The nation is the world's fastest-growing major economy, the world's 
              largest manufacturer and exporter and has the world's largest standing army by military personnel, 
              with the second-largest defense budget and is an officially recognized nuclear-weapon state. China legally recognizes 56 distinct ethnic groups, who altogether comprise the Zhonghua Minzu. 
              The largest of these nationalities are the ethnic Chinese or "Han", who constitute more than 90% of the 
              total population. The Han Chinese – the world's largest single ethnic group – outnumber other ethnic groups in 
              every provincial-level division except Tibet and Xinjiang. Ethnic minorities account for less than 10% of the 
              population of China, according to the 2010 census. Compared with the 2000 population census, the Han population 
              increased by 66,537,177 persons, or 5.74%, while the population of the 55 national minorities combined increased 
              by 7,362,627 persons, or 6.92%. The 2010 census recorded a total of 593,832 foreign nationals living in China. 
              The largest such groups were from South Korea (120,750), the United States (71,493) and Japan (66,159).</p>

            <h4>MEXICO</h4>
            <p><a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico" class = "credit-link" target="_blank"> From Wikipedia</a></p>
            <p>Mexico, officially the United Mexican States, is a country in the southern portion of North America. It is bordered 
              to the north by the United States; to the south and west by the Pacific Ocean; to the southeast by Guatemala, 
              Belize, and the Caribbean Sea; and to the east by the Gulf of Mexico. Mexico covers 1,972,550 square kilometers 
              (761,610 sq mi), making it the world's 13th-largest country by area; with approximately 126,014,024 
              inhabitants, it is the 10th-most-populous country and has the most Spanish-speakers. Mexico is organized as a 
              federation comprising 31 states and Mexico City, its capital and largest metropolis. Other major urban areas include 
              Guadalajara, Monterrey, Puebla, Toluca, Tijuana, Ciudad Juárez, and León. Mexico ranks first in the Americas and 
              seventh in the world for the number of UNESCO World Heritage Sites. It is also one of the world's 17 megadiverse 
              countries, ranking fifth in natural biodiversity. Mexico's rich cultural and biological heritage, as well as varied 
              climate and geography, makes it a major tourist destination: as of 2018, it was the sixth most-visited country in 
              the world, with 39 million international arrivals. Mexico is a member of United Nations, the G20, the Organisation 
              for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the World Trade Organization (WTO), the Asia-Pacific Economic 
              Cooperation forum, the Organization of American States, Community of Latin American and Caribbean States, and the 
              Organization of Ibero-American States. Mexico is located between latitudes 14° and 33°N, and longitudes 86° and 119°W in the southern portion of North 
              America. Almost all of Mexico lies in the North American Plate, with small parts of the Baja California peninsula 
              on the Pacific and Cocos Plates. Geophysically, some geographers include the territory east of the Isthmus of 
              Tehuantepec (around 12% of the total) within Central America. Geopolitically, however, Mexico is entirely considered 
              part of North America, along with Canada and the United States. As of 2017, it is estimated that 1.2 million foreigners have settled in the country, 
              up from nearly 1 million in 2010. The vast majority of migrants come from the United States (900,000), 
              making Mexico the top destination for U.S. citizens abroad. The second largest group comes from neighboring 
              Guatemala (54,500), followed by Spain (27,600). Other major sources of migration are fellow Latin American 
              countries, which include Colombia (20,600), Argentina (19,200) and Cuba (18,100). Historically, the Lebanese 
              diaspora and the German-born Mennonite migration have left a notorious impact in the country's culture, 
              particularly in its cuisine and traditional music.</p>
